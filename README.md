# Weather-dataset-Analysis
The Weather dataset is a time-series data set with per hour information about the weather conditions at a particular location. It records Temperature,Dew point Temperature,Relative Humidity,Wind speed,
visisbility,Presssure and Conditions.
The data is avaiilable as a csv file.The datais being analyzed using pandas a python library.

# The project answers the following questions

## Q1. Find all the unique 'Wind Speed' values in the data

## Q2. Find the number of items when the "Weather is clear"

## Q3. Find the number of times when the 'Wind Speedd was exactly 4 km/h'
## Q4. Find out all the Null Values in the dataQ5. Rename the column name 'Weather' of the dataframe to 'Weather Condition'

# #Q6. What is the mean Visisbility

## Q7. What is the standard deviation of 'Pressure' in the data

## Q8. What is the variance of 'Relative Humidity' in this data

## Q9. Find all instances when 'Snow' was recorded

## Q10. Find all the instances where 'Wind Speed is above 24' and 'Visibility is 25'

## Q11. What is the mean value of each column against each 'Weather Condition

## Q12. What is the Minimum and Maximun value of each column against 'Weather Condition'

## Q13. Show all the records when the weather is 'Fog'

## Q14. Find all instances where weather is 'Clear' or 'Visibility is above 40'

## Q15. Find all instances when :

### 'Weather is clear' and 'Relative Humidity is greater than 50'
### or
### 'Visibility is above 40'
